name: Oaxaca Old Fashioned
instructions: Combine all the ingredients except the orange twist in an Old Fashioned glass filled with one large ice cube. Stir until chilled. To top with a flamed orange twist, carefully hold a piece of orange peel about the size of a silver dollar, skin side down, over the drink. Light a match and use it to warm the skin side of the peel. Holding the match a few inches above the drink, quickly squeeze the peel in the direction of the match. The oil from the peel will briefly ignite, landing over the drinkâ€™s surface.
