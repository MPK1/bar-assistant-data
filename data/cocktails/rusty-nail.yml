    A Rusty Nail can be served in an old-fashioned glass on the rocks, or "up" in a stemmed glass. It is most commonly served over ice. A Rusty Nail served without ice is sometimes called a Straight Up Nail.

      - **The Rusty Ale**, in which a shot of Drambuie is added to any beer, served without ice.
      - **The Smoky Nail**, which uses Islay whisky (very smoky in flavor) in place of blended Scotch whisky.
      - **The Clavo Ahumado** (Spanish for "smoky nail"), using mezcal instead of blended Scotch whisky.
      - **The Railroad Spike**, often served at brunch and made with approximately four parts Cold brewed coffee to one part Drambuie in a tall glass over ice.
      - **The Donald Sutherland**, which substitutes Canadian rye whisky for blended Scotch whisky.
