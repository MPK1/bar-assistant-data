instructions: 'Refrigerate ingredients then layer in chilled glass by carefully pouring in the ingredient order.'
description: 'The origins of the B-52 are not well documented, but one claim is that the B-52 was invented by Peter Fich, a head bartender at the Banff Springs Hotel in Alberta, Canada. Fich named all of his new drinks after favorite bands, albums, and songs, and he supposedly named the drink after the band of the same name, not directly after the US B-52 Stratofortress bomber after which the band was named.'
