    It was first created in 1919 in London by Harry MacElhone and it was equal parts creme de menthe, triple sec and lemon juice. But four years later [1923], when he was working in Paris, France, at Harry&amp;#039;s American Bar, he had changed the recipe. He had swapped out the creme de menthe, for gin. Which, was a good move. But then, four years later [1927], he puts out the book &amp;quot;Barflies and Cocktails&amp;quot; and includes the White Lady, but the recipe no longer had gin. It went back to crem√© de menthe, and it didn&amp;#039;t have lemon juice. It had Brandy, and it was no longer equal parts. It was a completely different drink.

    But then, 3 years later, in 1930, Harry Craddock steps in and he puts, in the &amp;quot;The Savoy Cocktail Book&amp;quot;, the White Lady. Gin, triple sec and lemon juice, only he increases the amount of gin to make a drier cocktail. Which is pretty much the cocktail we have today... and it&amp;#039;s a great drink.

    A few years after this drink became popular at the American Bar at the Savoy in London, because of Harry Craddock. One of the managers, suggested putting in a little egg white. But to this day, the egg white is considered optional.
