    This classic is a contentious and sensitive topic with serious Martini drinkers. The way one drinks a Martini is simply a matter of personal preference.

    **Variations:**
    - Dry Martini: A dry martini is made with little to no vermouth
    - 50/50 Martini: Equal parts vermouth and gin
    - Dirty Martini: A Dirty Martini simply requires a splash of olive juice and a substitution of a good, dry olive (or two) for garnish.
    - Gibson: Use cocktail onion for garnish
garnish: Squeeze oil from lemon peel onto the drink, or garnish with green olives if requested.
