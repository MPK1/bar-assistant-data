    The Final Ward is perhaps the best-know riff on the classic Last Word and was created in 2007 by Phil Ward at Death & Co. NYC. It is still comprised of equal parts with rye whiskey replacing the gin and fresh lemon juice in place of lime.

    The Last Word is a gin-based prohibition-era cocktail which was rediscovered in 2004 and becoming a cult hit in the Seattle area.
