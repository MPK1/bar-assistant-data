    This spin on the Hemingway Daiquiri was created in 2006 by Katie Stipe (who&#039;s at New York&#039;s Vandaag now.) Tequila adds warmth to bitter Campari; it&#039;s a luxurious cocktail that&#039;s a bit like sipping candied grapefruit peel.

    &quot;Katie describes this drink as her first &quot;Aha!&quot; moment when she took a favorite classic cocktail, the Hemingway Daiquiri, and used it as a template to create something new.&quot; (Source: Jim Meehan&#039;s PDT Cocktail Book.)

    For those that might need two cocktails today, you can check out the Hemingway Daiquiri mentioned above, in last year&#039;s Advent of Cocktails, here: AoC 2021, Dec 12: Hemingway Daiquiri
