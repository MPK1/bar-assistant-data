_id: white-Russian
name: White Russian
instructions: |-
    1. Combine the vodka, coffee liqueur and ice cubes in a cocktail shaker
    2. Shake well and strain into an ice-filled short tumbler
    3. Lightly beat the single cream until just frothy and pour onto the drink over the back of a spoon, to help make it float
description: Misleadingly, this sophisticated cocktail is not in fact Russian in origin, but gets its name from vodka being the base spirit. Traditionally a Black Russian, it becomes a White Russian with the addition of cream.
garnish: Freshly grated nutmeg
