name: Port Light
instructions: Shake with ice, Dump
description: |-
    In the Trader Vic’s tradition, this drink is served in a Port Light glass, which resembles a rounded lantern with red glass and gold trim; the same glass in green is called a Starboard Light glass. A Port Light Highball appears in Trader Vic’s Bartender’s Guide (1947), but it’s very different from this drink, which Jeff “Beachbum” Berry discovered at the Kahiki Restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, in 1996.

    Unusual Tiki cocktail. Buffalo Trace works well here. Rye is not recommended for this one.
garnish: Mint
