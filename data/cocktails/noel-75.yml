description: 'If you’re not in the mood for something too heavy for Christmas then this riff on a French 75 might be right up your alley! We head back to our Christmas Tree Syrup to add in a huge fir note to the cocktail while fresh cucumber ties into our peculiar base spirit, bringing together our seasonal vibe with just a touch of summery refreshment. This would be great to pre-batch for a party: pour into a flute and top with Prosecco. Boom, done!'
