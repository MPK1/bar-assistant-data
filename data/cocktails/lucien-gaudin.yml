instructions: '1. Combine ingredients in a mixing glass and fill with ice. Stir well and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. A twist of orange peel is not out of place here.'
description: 'Introducing the Lucien Gaudin. Named for an early 20th century French Olympic fencer, the Lucien Gaudin starts off in the manner of a Negroni by combining gin with Campari. With the addition of Cointreau and dry vermouth the result is a pleasantly bitter drink that is simultaneously rich and dry--a challenging flavor to create which is all the more enjoyable because of its rarity.'
