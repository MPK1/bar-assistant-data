description: 'The flagship drink at Dante is named after Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was a central figure in the unification of Italy. Its two ingredients—Campari from the north acting as a nod to the red shirts worn by Garibaldi’s freedom fighters and bright orange representing Sicily to the south—are symbolic of its heritage.'
