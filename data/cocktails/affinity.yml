description: 'This off-the-radar classic cocktail was originally made with equal measures of Scotch whisky, dry vermouth, and sweet vermouth. At Bramble in Edinburgh, co-owner Jason Scott has developed, well, an affinity for the Affinity, brushing up the original recipe by using a Highland single malt (Glenmorangie 10 year old) and swapping in Byrrh Grand Quinquina for the sweet vermouth. The crowning touch? Bramble ages its mixture in barrels; they originally used small casks custom-made for the cocktails by Glenmorangie and are currently using 50-liter barrels that previously held oloroso sherry, aging the cocktail for between three and nine months and using a solera system for consistency. Until you can get to Edinburgh to try one of Bramble’s barrel-aged Affinity cocktails in person, here’s the base recipe, which should give you a delicious taste of the possibilities.'
