description: Initially, the most common highball was made with Scotch whisky and carbonated water, known simply as a "Scotch and soda". New York barman Patrick Duffy claimed the highball was brought to the U.S. in 1894 from England by actor E. J. Ratcliffe. Bartender Tip:Simple and refreshing cocktail with surprising complexity. One part whisky, two parts mixer, garnished with a lemon wedge and served over ice in a highball glass; the whisky highball is as simple as it is delicious
