description: 'Amaretto is an Italian liqueur that’s typically flavored with almonds or apricot stones. Its distinctive flavor can be incorporated into numerous cocktails, but it’s best known for the Amaretto Sour, a drink that tends to get a bad rap. That’s because, too often, the cocktail is overly sweet and relies on premade sour mix. '
garnish: Spray aromatic bitters over foaming cocktail from atomiser and then garnish with lemon & cherry sail (lemon slice & Luxardo Maraschino cherry on stick)
