description: In Dale DeGroff’s revised and updated The New Craft of the Cocktail, he details the backstory of the Cardinale cocktail, a 1950’s-era variation on the classic Negroni. “Giovanni Raimondo, the bartender at the Hotel Excelsior, crafted this variation in an effort to re-create the favorite of a German cardinal who occasionally sought refreshment at the bar of the great hotel; the use of dry vermouth created a closer match to the cardinal’s robes.”
