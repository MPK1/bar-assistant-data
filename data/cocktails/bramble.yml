    2. Shake well with ice
    3. Strain into chilled old fashioned glass filled with crushed ice
    4. Pour the blackberry liqueur (Crème de Mûre) over the top of the drink, in a circular motion.
description: 'The Bramble was created in London, in 1984, by Dick Bradsell. At the time, Bradsell worked at a bar in Soho called Fred&#039;s Club, and he wanted to create a British cocktail. Memories of going blackberrying in his childhood on the Isle of Wight provided the inspiration for the Bramble.'
garnish: 'Garnish optionally with a lemon slice and blackberries.'
