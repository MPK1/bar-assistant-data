    The Wisconsin Old Fashioned is the state’s variation on the classic Old Fashioned cocktail, with brandy and lemon lime soda. The typical Old Fashioned recipe uses bourbon mixed with a muddled sugar cube and bitters. So where did the brandy Old Fashioned come from?


    Here’s the theory! (Per Jerry Minnich, at least.) A company of brothers debuted their Korbel brandy at the World’s Fair in 1893 in Chicago, which lots of Wisconsinites attended. A large percentage of Wisconsin at the time was German, and Germans preferred brandy over bourbon. Korbel brandy become a hit, and birthed this state’s funky variation on the classic cocktail. To this day, the drink is often served with Korbel brandy!
