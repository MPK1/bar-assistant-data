description: 'The drink was created in 2005 by Australian bartender Sam Ross living in New York at the time. Its name derives from the drug penicillin, discovered by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming, hinting to the medicinal properties of some of its ingredients, with suggested effects similar to that of a hot toddy which is said to relieve the symptoms of cold and flu.'
garnish: 'Garnish with candied ginger.'
