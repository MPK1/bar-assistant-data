    Audrey Sanders, mixology royalty, created this drink as a homage to the New York City’s Little Italy neighborhood. We first read about it in Imbibe magazine, where they recommended garnish with brandied cherries and letting a little of the cherry liquid dribble into the glass – a modification we heartily endorse.

    Not gonna lie – the Little Italy a love-it-or-hate it flavor. If you’re a fan of bitter flavors and you’re looking for an alternative to yet another Negroni, it may just be up your alley. It really is a superb after-dinner drink, where the medicinal overtones can be explained away as part of the history of the digestíf as a post-meal tummy-soother.

    Make sure to have very fresh vermouth on hand for this drink; it’s bitter enough without the acrid tang of old vermouth.
