description: 'The oldest historical mention of a whiskey sour was published in the Wisconsin newspaper, Waukesha Plain Dealer, in 1870. With egg white included, it is sometimes called a Boston Sour; when the whiskey used is a Scotch, it is called a Scotch Sour. With a few bar spoons of full-bodied red wine floated on top, it is often referred to as a New York Sour. It is shaken and served either straight up or over ice.'
garnish: 'Garnish with a half orange slice and maraschino cherry, optionally use orange zest.'
