description: |-
    The Bee's Knees was invented by Frank Meier, an Austrian-born, part Jewish bartender who was the first head bartender at the Ritz in Paris in 1921, when its Cafe Parisian opened its doors.

    The name comes from prohibition-era slang meaning "the best".
garnish: Optionally garnish with a lemon or orange zest.
