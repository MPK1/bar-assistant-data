description: '"The squeaky wheel gets the oil", my father always used to tell me. This cocktail demands that level of attention, says Nicholas Bennett of Cedricâ€™s at the Shed of this Mezcal Negroni. "I enjoy the combination of coffee and bitters, and I will occasionally add a touch of Angostura to my coffee in the morning, so the blend of St. George NOLA Coffee Liqueur and Campari was almost a no-brainer when I was developing this Negroni variation. The splash of amaretto really rounds out the cocktail."'
