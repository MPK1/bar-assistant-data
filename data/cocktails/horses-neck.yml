description: 'Dating back to the 1890s, it was a non-alcoholic mixture of ginger ale, ice and lemon peel. By the 1910s, brandy, or bourbon would be added for a "Horse''s Neck with a Kick" or a "Stiff Horse''s Neck". The non-alcoholic version was still served in upstate New York in the late 1950s and early 60s, but eventually it was phased out.'
garnish: 'Garnish with a rind of one lemon spiral.'
