    The Alexander cocktail was born in London in 1922 by Hery Mc Elhone, at Ciro’s Club in honor of a famous bride, at the beginning it was called Panama, Gin was used instead of Cognac and light cocoa cream instead of dark.

    Throughout its history, Alexander has given rise to many other variations:

    **Grasshopper**: This variant is also part of the Iba list and involves the use of crème de menthe verde instead of cognac.

    **Alexandra**: Use the light cocoa cream instead of the dark one and replace the nutmeg with cocoa.

    **Alexander’s Sister**: Use crème de menthe instead of crème de cacao

    **Alejandro**: Replace cognac with rum
garnish: 'Sprinkle ground nutmeg on top.'
