    It’s back to basics with another delicious simple Sasha Petraske recipe!

    I have really fallen in love with built-in-glass drinks. These are just constructed and mixed in a standard rocks glass or whatever you’re drinking from, and requires no additional equipment to stir, shake, or strain.

    Not only is it ultra simple with fewer things to wash, the extra potency to start sets the mood and anchors your palate for the rest of the drink as you slowly sip. I personally looove the super spirit-forward libations, and this intensity actually helps keep me from drinking it too quickly (often a problem for me for cocktails!). Something about the more rustic nature of it compared to a carefully chilled stirred&strained cocktail just really hits the spot for me.
