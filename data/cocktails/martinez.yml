description: |-
    The Martinez is a classic cocktail that is widely regarded as the direct precursor to the Martini.
    It serves as the basis for many modern cocktails, and several different versions of the original exist.
    These are generally distinguished by the accompaniment of either Maraschino or Curacao, as well as differences in gin or bitters. 
garnish: 'Lemon zest.'
