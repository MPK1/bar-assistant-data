description: 'The Vesper or Vesper Martini is a cocktail that was originally made of gin, vodka, and Kina Lillet. The formulations of its ingredients have changed since its original publication in print, and so some modern bartenders have created new versions which attempt to more closely mimic the original taste. The drink was invented and named by Ian Fleming in the 1953 James Bond novel Casino Royale.'
