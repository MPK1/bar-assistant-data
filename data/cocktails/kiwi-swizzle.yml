description: Kiwi is underrated and underused! Tiki is the obvious first cocktail style to work kiwi in to, plus tiki and kiwi are surprisingly similar words... Fun! Chartreuse's herbal explosion is tempered by the unrefined cane character of our Demerara Gum Syrup. This is a stellar and novel tropical cocktail.
garnish: pineapple fronds slice of kiwi
