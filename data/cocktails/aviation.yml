    Aviation was created in New York at the Walkick hotel by the head bartender Hugo Ensslin while he was writing his book “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” (1916) one of the last cocktail books published before the start of American Prohibition.

    Lately David Wondrich found the aviation recipe in a 1911 magazine, so the recipe is thought to have been born earlier then 1916.

    In his book Ensslin also indicates the type of Gin to be used ‘El Bart Gin “and the recipe is made up in addition to gin, with lemon juice, maraschino and Creme di Violette.

    The recipe is found again in Harry Craddock’s 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book but without the Creme de Violette, this probably due to the difficulty of finding the violet cream during the post-war period In the 1960s it was still unavailable and therefore, simply, the basic ingredient of the Aviation cocktail was discontinued and the bartenders definitively gave up the characteristic blue color of the drink.

    The IBA proposes it today in its original version with the creme de violette which is now on the market again.  This fragrant ingredient not only gave the mix a sweetly floral taste, but also gave it a beautiful sky blue color.
