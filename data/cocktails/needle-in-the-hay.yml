description: 'The Needle in the Hay was created by Los Angeles-based mixologist Devon Tarby. She was a contributor to the well known cocktail book, Cocktail Codex (from the authors and owners of Death & Co). This Islay whisky cocktail is what you would imagine a Autumn cocktail to be - smoky, sweet maple flavours and undertones of apple from the brandy.'
