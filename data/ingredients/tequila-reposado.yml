name: Tequila Reposado
description: |-
    Tequila Reposado is a type of tequila that has been aged or "rested" in oak barrels for a specific period, giving it a mellower and more complex flavor compared to Tequila Blanco (unaged tequila). The term "reposado" translates to "rested" in Spanish.

    Reposado occupies a middle ground between the youthful vibrancy of Blanco tequila and the more mature and complex characteristics of AÃ±ejo tequila. It appeals to those who appreciate a balance of agave flavor and the influence of oak aging.
