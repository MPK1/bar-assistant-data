name: Walnut Liqueur
description: |-
    Walnut liqueur is known in Austria and Germany as Nüsse or Nüssenschnaps, in France as Noix, and in Italy as Nocino. Residents of Alpine regions traditionally drink walnut liqueurs during Christmastime. The spice and depth pair well with wintery nights and hearty meals. Serve to guests in a cordial glass, post-dinner or as an unexpected dessert pairing. In cocktails, Nux Alpina is an extraordinary complement to brown spirits and dark fortified wines, like Madeira, sherry and sweet red vermouth.
