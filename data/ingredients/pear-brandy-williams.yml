description: |-
    The Purkhart Pear Williams Brandy uses only “Williams” pears from South Tirol (also known as Alto Adige or Südtirol), whose pears are prized for their opulent and creamy ripe fruit fragrance. Lively and stimulating on the palate, this eau-de-vie reveals a depth of pear flavor that carries well into the finish. Made only from distilled pears and water. Enjoy on its own, stir with dry vermouth for a perfumed Martini variation, or make uncommonly aromatic sour cocktails. 100% Reines Destillat Williamsbrand.
