_id: grapefruit-bitters
name: Grapefruit bitters
description: These grapefruit bitters are best friends to gin, vodka, Blanco tequila, and light rum and are a wonderful ingredient for drinks that may otherwise taste excessively sweet. Give a modern twist to a classic Gin & Tonic, add a few dashes to a Daiquiri or Margarita or add a new layer of complexity to cocktails that traditionally didnâ€™t include bitters.
