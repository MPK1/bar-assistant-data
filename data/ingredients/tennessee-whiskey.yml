description: |-
    Tennessee whiskey is a specific type of American whiskey that is closely associated with the state of Tennessee and is known for its distinctive production process, which includes the Lincoln County Process.

    The distinguishing feature of Tennessee whiskey is the use of the Lincoln County Process, a filtration method in which the whiskey is filtered through, or steeped in, sugar maple charcoal before entering the barrels for aging. This process is believed to impart additional smoothness and mellowness to the final product. Not all Tennessee whiskeys use this process, but it is a defining characteristic for those that do.
