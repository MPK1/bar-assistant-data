name: Vermouth Bianco
description: |-
    First launched way back in 1910, Bianco is a wonderful style of vermouth. First inspired by the white flowers of vanilla plants, the bottling has been nicknamed ‘Bianchissimo’, meaning “the whitest of the white”.

    Whilst it looks like a dry vermouth, this is a sweeter style, which offers flavours of juicy citrus, berries, peaches and apricots, some mixed herbs, a touch of charcoal, vanilla, honey, apples, and some faint herby bitterness.

    Delicate and well balanced, this vermouth is a bartender’s dream, offering sweet complexity that is perfect in White Negronis and Martini style drinks.
