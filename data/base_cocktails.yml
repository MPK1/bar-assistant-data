    name: Americano
    description: "The story of the Americano dates back to the second half of the 1800s in Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan.  Over the years the cocktail acquires notoriety thanks to some homages from the world of cinema, including James Bond (007 Casino Royale) whose favorite cocktail was, precisely, the Americano.\n\nThe nickname “American” was born when Primo Carnera, a giant Italian boxer, became world heavyweight champion at Madison Square Garden in New York.  When Carnera returned to Italy with the title, he was greeted with this very Italian cocktail which, for the occasion, was called “Americano”.\n\nThe Americano entered the IBA Cocktail List only in 1987 but, in reality, it was a cocktail that spread all over Italy during the 1930s."
    instructions: "1. Mix the ingredients directly in an old fashioned glass filled with ice cubes.\n2. Add a splash of Soda Water.\n3. Stir gently."

    name: 'Angel Face'
    description: "Although the origin of the cocktail is not known, the main hypotheses assume that it was born in the twenties of the twentieth century in France: this thesis would prove the presence of calvados, a liqueur commonly used in France and, in particular, in that period, as an epidemic of phylloxera in European vineyards had limited the production of brandy.\nOn this basis, one of the most frequent hypotheses has it that the cocktail was created by Harry MacElhone, founder of Harry’s New York Bar in Paris on July 19, 1919, in honor of the celebrations for the victory of the First World War.\nThe first reliable evidence, however, dates back to 1930 when Harry Craddock included the Angel Face among the recipes of his book “Savoy cocktail book”. Some sources indicate that the name derives from that of an American gangster active during Prohibition; less likely the dedication to Rick Blaine, the protagonist of Casablanca played by Humphrey Bogart, as the film follows the first testimonies (1942)."

    name: Aviation
    description: "Aviation was created in New York at the Walkick hotel by the head bartender Hugo Ensslin while he was writing his book “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” (1916) one of the last cocktail books published before the start of American Prohibition.\n\nLately David Wondrich found the aviation recipe in a 1911 magazine, so the recipe is thought to have been born earlier then 1916.\n\nIn his book Ensslin also indicates the type of Gin to be used ‘El Bart Gin “and the recipe is made up in addition to gin, with lemon juice, maraschino and Creme di Violette.\n\nThe recipe is found again in Harry Craddock’s 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book but without the Creme de Violette, this probably due to the difficulty of finding the violet cream during the post-war period In the 1960s it was still unavailable and therefore, simply, the basic ingredient of the Aviation cocktail was discontinued and the bartenders definitively gave up the characteristic blue color of the drink.\n\nThe IBA proposes it today in its original version with the creme de violette which is now on the market again.  This fragrant ingredient not only gave the mix a sweetly floral taste, but also gave it a beautiful sky blue color."

    name: Caipirinha
    description: "Although the origin of the drink is unknown, one account says it came about around 1918 in the region of Alentejo in Portugal, with a popular recipe made with lemon, garlic, and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Another account is that Caipirinha is based on Poncha, an alcoholic drink from Madeira, Portugal. The main ingredient is aguardente de cana, which is made from sugar cane. Sugar cane production was switched from Madeira to Brazil by the Portuguese as they needed more land to plant it on. Before this people in Madeira had already created aguardente de cana, which was the ancestor to cachaça.\n\nVariations:\n\n**CAIPIROSKA** – Instead of Cachaça use Vodka;"

    name: 'Cuba Libre'
    description: "The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanish–American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most-popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.\n\nTraditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola (\"Coke\") and the alcohol is a light rum such as Bacardi; however, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included.

        This classic is a contentious and sensitive topic with serious Martini drinkers. The way one drinks a Martini is simply a matter of personal preference.

        **Variations:**
        - Dry Martini: A dry martini is made with little to no vermouth
        - 50/50 Martini: Equal parts vermouth and gin
        - Dirty Martini: A Dirty Martini simply requires a splash of olive juice and a substitution of a good, dry olive (or two) for garnish.

    name: Fernandito
    description: "The cocktail first became popular among the youth of the college town of Córdoba, in the 1980s and—impulsed by an advertising campaign led by Fratelli Branca—its consumption grew in popularity during the following decades to become widespread throughout the country, surpassed only by that of beer and wine. It is now considered a cultural icon of Argentina and is especially associated with its home province of Córdoba, where the drink is most consumed. The popularity of fernet con coca is such that Argentina consumes more than 75% of all fernet produced globally. The cocktail can also be found in some of its bordering countries, like Uruguay.\n\nAlthough typically made with Fernet-Branca and Coca-Cola, several amaro brands have appeared in Argentina since its popularization, as well as ready-to-drink versions.

    name: 'Japanese cocktail'
    description: "The Japanese cocktail is notorious for a handful of things: it's a very old cocktail, published in Jerry Thomas’s landmark 1862 book How to Mix Drinks; it was the first mixed drink to be named something other than “Whiskey Cocktail”, “Brandy Cocktail”, or some other similarly obvious epithet; it might be the only cocktail Thomas invented himself; and finally, it was the first cocktail to feature more than a dash of a fancy sweetener, orgeat."

    description: 'Popular history suggests that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the mid-1870s, where it was invented by Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated—"the Manhattan cocktail". However, Lady Randolph was in France at the time and pregnant, so the story is likely a fiction.'

    name: Paloma
    description: 'The Paloma is a refreshing, easy-to-make cooler that combines tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. Its origin story is nebulous, but most reports peg its creation to the 1950s. Blanco tequila is the traditional choice, but lightly aged reposado also makes a fine drink. In this case, it’s best to keep the añejo capped, as the well-aged expression’s oaky profile disrupts that clean, refreshing taste you want in a Paloma. '
    instructions: 'Poor the tequila into a highball glass, squeeze the lime juice. Add ice and salt, fill up pink grapefruit soda. Stir gently.'

    name: 'Pisco Sour'
    description: "A pisco sour is an alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian origin that is typical of the cuisines from Peru. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components.\nThe Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lemon juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters.\nThe Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white.\nOther variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves."
    instructions: "Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice.\nShake and strain into a chilled goblet glass."

He claims not to remember which bar he was working at at the time, but tells the story of how he created the recipe for personal friends wishing to hold a cocktail party while minimizing the amount of money they had to spend on alcohol. Participants were provided with the vodka, cassis, sugar syrup and lemon juice, and were asked to bring their own sparkling wine. It is named for the russian vodka, and the Tom Collins, which is a spring drink.'
    instructions: 'Pour all ingredients into a cocktail shaker except the sparkling wine, shake well with ice, strain into a chilled tall tumbler glass filled with ice, and top up with sparkling wine.'

It is commonly served in bars, restaurants, and chiringuitos and at festivities throughout Portugal and Spain."
    instructions: "1. Chop the orange (leaving the peel on) and apple into bite-sized chunks, then add them to the bottom of a pitcher. Sprinkle them with sugar and stir. Let them stand for 20 minutes at room temperature.\n2. After 20 minutes, pour in the red wine, brandy, orange liqueur, and lemon rounds. Stir and refrigerate 1 to 4 hours. (Don’t go beyond 4 hours or the fruit texture starts to degrade.)\n3. Pour the sangria into ice filled glasses and top with a splash of sparkling water (if desired). Add fruit to each glass, preferably on long skewers for easy snacking."

    name: Sazerac
    description: "The Sazerac is a local variation of a cognac or whiskey cocktail originally from New Orleans, named for the Sazerac de Forge et Fils brand of cognac brandy that served as its original main ingredient.\nThe drink is most traditionally a combination of cognac or rye whiskey, absinthe, Peychaud's Bitters, and sugar, although bourbon whiskey is sometimes substituted for the rye and Herbsaint is sometimes substituted for the absinthe.\nSome claim it is the oldest known American cocktail, with origins in antebellum New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is among those who dispute this, and American instances of published usage of the word cocktail to describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century."
    instructions: "1. Rinse a chilled old-fashioned glass with the absinthe.\n2. Add crushed ice and set it aside.\n3. Stir the remaining ingredients over ice in a mixing glass.\n4. Discard the ice and any excess absinthe from the prepared glass.\n5. Strain the mixed drink into the glass."

    name: Sidecar
    description: "The exact origin of the sidecar is unclear, but it is thought to have been invented around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. The drink was directly named for the motorcycle attachment, which was very commonly used back then.\n\nLike the daiquiri, the sidecar evolved from the original sour formula, but sidecars are often drier than sours, combining liqueurs like curaçao with citrus. Sidecars are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness."

    name: 'Tommy’s Margarita'
    description: "Tommy's margarita was conceived in San Francisco in 1990 by Julio Bermejo at his parents' restaurant called Tommy's (not to be confused with Tommy's Place in Juárez, Mexico. See Margarita Origin). Bermejo had been recently introduced to agave nectar as an ingredient, and, although it was still expensive at the time, he preferred to use it to enhance the agave flavor of the cocktail instead of using triple sec to highlight the citrus flavor in the original Margarita recipe. In 2008, it became the first venue specific cocktail to be added to the IBA manual."
    instructions: 'Pour all ingredients into a cocktail shaker, shake well with ice, strain into a chilled rocks glass filled with ice.'
    garnish: 'Garnish with a lime slice.'

        The Final Ward is perhaps the best-know riff on the classic Last Word and was created in 2007 by Phil Ward at Death &amp; Co. NYC. It is still comprised of equal parts with rye whiskey replacing the gin and fresh lemon juice in place of lime.

        The Last Word is a gin-based prohibition-era cocktail which was rediscovered in 2004 and becoming a cult hit in the Seattle area.

    description: 'As reported by the magazines Mixology and Der Spiegel, the Hugo was conceived in 2005 by Naturns bar manager Roland Gruber (aka A.K.) at San Zeno Bar, as an alternative to Spritz Veneziano, and quickly spread beyond the borders of South Tyrol. Initially, the recipe provided for the use of lemon balm syrup, then in practice replaced by elderflower syrup, more easily available.'

The drink is served at bars all across Germany—so much so that one bartender, griping about the amount of basil-muddling required to make it, once called it “Meyer’s curse.”'

    name: 'Picante de la Casa'
    instructions: |-
        1. Cut a small piece of chili (about ¼ inch wide) and press with muddler in the shaker tin.
        2. Hand clap the cilantro (to release the aroma, place the leaves or sprig in one hand and gently smack it with the other – this warms up the garnish slightly and starts to extract the oils before you use it), and drop in.
        3. Add the rest of the ingredients, shake and fine strain into an ice-filled rocks glass (a short tumbler used for serving spirits).
        4. Cut off the top end  the chili pepper and place – stem upwards – on top.
    garnish: 'Top end (stem) of the chilli pepper'

        Lovers of the margarita, we have a treat for you here! The Picante de la Casa Cocktail, also called the Soho House Picante or Soho House Tonic, is a creation of the Soho House Club. That is a group of private members&#039; clubs with its origin in Soho in the Londoner West End. The cocktail, however, does not have its roots in England but in West Hollywood, USA. -Although, actually, it looks like it could be straight out of Mexico.

        Soho House have shared the recipe for their picante de la casa. The picante is based on the much-loved margarita, but the picante cocktail ingredients includes chilli and coriander – to add a little extra heat and spice. It is revelatory – and a drink you’ll be coming back to.
